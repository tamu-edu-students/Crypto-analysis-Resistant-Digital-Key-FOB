# Crypto-analysis-Resistant-Digital-Key-FOB
ECEN 403 - 904 - Team 2

Project Description: The purpose of our project is to develop an application which will be able to securely lock/unlock and start/turn off a vehicle. This application will work to demostrate the cryptography technology developed by Sandia National Laboratories and a locking mechanism with CANBUS architecture will be used to aid in this demonstration.

This GitHub contains the Android Application subsytem in the folder labeled "DigitalKeyFOBcomp", the Locking Mechanism subsystem files are in the folder labeled "Adriana", and the Communication and Cryptography subsystem files are located in the folder labeled "Courtney".

ECEN 403 Project Updates for Adriana and Courtney are located in the folders with their names. ECEN 404 project updates for the whole group is in the document called "ECEN 404 Project Updates".
