During the last week I hashed out the final details of how the technology works from our sponser. I am going to start this week focusing in on the three algorithums and the specifics of how they work. The goal is by next Tuesday (start of lab) to have planned out the code for all three algorithums so I will be ready to start coding next week. I plan to code the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Protocol first, then the AES-256, and finally the SHA-256.
