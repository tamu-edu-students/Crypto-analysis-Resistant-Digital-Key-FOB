Instructions for MCU Code:

>There is a custom Partition Table due to the external library added to the ESP-IDF components library
>In the menuconfig (should already be configured but just in case)
	->Toggle Rfft on
	->Change flash size to 8M
	->Toggle error checking on
	->Change partition table to custom and when prompted to specify file type 	'mcu_partition_table.csv'


>Unzip 'cryptopp' library and add to 'IDF_PATH/esp-idf/components' 
(library already has its own 'CMakeLists.txt' file for compilation)
