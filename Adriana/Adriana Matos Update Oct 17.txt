-Today I was working on replacing capacitor, resistor, and inductor parts on the completed schematic so I can transfer the parts easier to the PCB design from the Schematic
-The PCB design has been started but routing has not been done just yet, which would be done within the next week
-I am hoping to get the PCB design ordered by next week
