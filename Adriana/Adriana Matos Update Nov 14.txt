-I have finished soldering the PCB and tested to see if it will power on; it does!
-I got into some trouble working with an Arduino Library in VS Code, so I spent a few days trying to figure out why it wouldn't work and what was wrong
-Will now start programming the ESP32 and testing the code to see if it works
-Have tested an example code with the ESP32 DevKit to test if the LED lights would work; need to work on the actual LED code
