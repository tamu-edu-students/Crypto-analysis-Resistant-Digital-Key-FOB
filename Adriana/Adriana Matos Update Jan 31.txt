-This week we tried to integrate the application and microcontroller together through bluetooth, but something was interrupting the connection
-Tried to troubleshoot why the connection wasn't working with the application in specific, but would work with a regular bluetooth terminal application on an android device.
-checked out an android telephone so I could test the bluetooth functionalities outside of lab.
