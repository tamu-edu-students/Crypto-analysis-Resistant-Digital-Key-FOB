-This week I worked with Jeremy to continue trying to connect the application to the microcontroller through bluetooth.
-We were finally able to connect the application and the microcontroller through bluetooth, by changing the UUID in Jeremy's code to match the UUID of the Bluetooth Serial library I was using to code the bluetooth functionalities.
